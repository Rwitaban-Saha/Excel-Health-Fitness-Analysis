# 📘 Health & Fitness Analysis (Ms-Excel)

## 🗂 Dataset Description

The dataset consists of multiple interrelated sheets including user profiles, daily health logs, calorie intake and burn, BMI calculations, step tracking, workout hours, and goal progress metrics.

## 📖Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing health and fitness-related data using Microsoft Excel.
The objective is to track user activity, calorie intake & burn, water consumption, workout duration, BMI, and daily steps to understand overall fitness patterns and goal progress.

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed

- BMI categorization and health status analysis
- Comparison of calorie intake vs calorie burn
- Daily steps tracking against fitness goals
- Workout duration impact on weight change
- Water intake consistency analysis

## ⚙ Process
- Removed inconsistent values, handled missing data, and standardized formats across multiple sheets for accurate analysis.
- Linked multiple datasets (user profile, health logs, calories, steps, BMI, goals) to perform end-to-end analysis.
-  Used Excel formulas to calculate BMI, calorie intake vs burn, workout hours, weight change, and goal achievement.
- Created charts and conditional formatting to highlight trends, gaps, and performance against fitness goals.

## 📈 Insights Generated

- A significant portion of users showed a daily calorie imbalance where intake exceeded burn on multiple days.
- Users consistently meeting step goals (≥8,000–10,000 steps/day) showed more stable weight trends.
- BMI analysis revealed noticeable variation across users, helping identify potential health risk groups.
- Consistent hydration and workout patterns were linked with better goal completion rates.
  
## 🎯 Conclusion

This analysis transforms raw health data into meaningful, actionable insights that help individuals clearly understand their daily activity, nutrition balance, and fitness progress. By combining BMI, calorie tracking, steps, workouts, and goals in a single view, users can identify unhealthy patterns early and make informed lifestyle decisions. The data enables people to track consistency, compare performance against targets, and measure progress over time rather than relying on assumptions.
